### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<p class="about-myself__introduce">
                  ðŸ”­ I am a student in frontend technologies and I'm seeking an opportunity to enter the development field. I have finished several development courses where I got knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL, which I lerned through the W3Schools platform. Throughout these courses, I focused on practical applications, including creating adaptive and responsive multi-page landing pages using the BEM methodology and the SASS preprocessor. I integrated interactive elements such as burger menus, carousels, sliders, pagination, internationalization, interaction with REST APIs, and pop-ups using JavaScript and CSS. You can find examples of my work on my GitHub profile: https://github.com/Iniuta. Additionally, I improved my problem-solving skills by solving algorithmic challenges in JavaScript on platforms like CodeWars: https://www.codewars.com/users/rsschool_3a3882472327a6a1.
I have a degree in psychology, and my extensive experience in this area helps me to easily find a common language with different people and interact well with them, so I'm a good team player. I am eager to learn, grow, and apply my skills in practice.
